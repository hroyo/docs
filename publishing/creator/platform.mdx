## Built by creators, for creators. 

#### The power of web3 in the hands of creators.
**Contrary to popular belief, Web3 is NOT for creators. It is for developer.**
As a hopeful creator at Seed Club, I experienced firsthand how Web3 fell short of its promises. 
From the chaos of creator royalties to the unsustainable surge of "creator tokens," the self-destructive "CC0" trend, and various extractive AI initiatives labeled as "revolutionary."
In truth, the majority in the Web3 creative space lack a creator's perspective, failing to comprehend the intricate nature of value creation in entertainment.

We need to do better. And it starts with IP-as-Protocol.

#### Our mission is to empower Crypto-Z creators and builders with creative freedom, allowing them to do their best work and leverage Web3 protocols to magnify their impact.

For instance, we envision the future of publishing at the convergence of web3 social, content, and digital ownership. 
This is why our first platform is built on top of Lens Protocol, allowing creators to benefit from its network effect, issue Crypto-Z NFTs while retaining ownership over the value they generate.
