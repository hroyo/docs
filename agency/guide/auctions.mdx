### Bids
The auction contract recieves bids. Unsuccessful bids are refunded automatically and the timing of refunds may be offset by 1 bidder.
In practical terms, this implies that a refund is processed for an unsuccessful bid when a higher bid is submitted.
A minimum bid increments makes sure only higher bids can be received.

### Minting & Settlement
The Encounter NFT is minted and transferred to the auction winner when the next auction commences. The NFT transfer is offset by 1 auction.
With each auction settlement, the transaction not only finalizes the current auction but also triggers the minting of a new Encounter, initiating the commencement of a new auction.

### New Auction
New Auctions can be triggered by anyone allowing the Encounters to continue as long as there are interested bidders or until all Encounters have been captured.

### What Happens When All Encounters Are... Captured?
Crypto-Z Season 1 is Encounters. Then Season 2 starts...
<Warning>SEASON 2 IS CLASSIFIED</Warning>

### Schedule
Encounters are set every 48h to start. We hope to accelerate the schedule in future. This flexibility allows the Agency to control its growth, adapt to external dynamics, and prepare for Season 2.


### Reserve Price
The Agency reserves the right to implement and change the reserve price.

### What happens if there is no bid?
