### Agents
Agents are the guardians of Crypto-Z. Each Encounter NFTs grants one vote, and allows holders to begin their journey as Crypto-Z Agents. All Encounter NFTs grant one vote (regardless of their rarity or their popularity). The more Encounters you hold the more votes you have. 


### Approval Right (aka voting)
Encounter NFTs allow holders not only to have ownership over notable art and narrative pieces, but to also have agency over the development of the Crypto-Z franchise itself in a permissionless way. 


### Pitch vs Proposal

Pitching happens off-chain, is informal and open. 
Proposals are on-chain, with enforced deal flow and curated.

Pitch, proposals, execution are the initiative of creative leaders. Every proposal must be ratified on-chain by a set number of Special Agents. 

Once ratified proposals are submitted and voted by the entire Agent community. If the proposal is successfully passed, it will be executed.

### Who can Pitch? Who can Propose?

Pitching is open to all. 
Proposing is reserved to a small elite team also known as "Special Agent".


### Special Agents

Special Agents are a small elite team in charge of evaluating and vetting each proposals submitted to the Agency.
They are recruited for their leadership skills and recieve a unique SOULBOUND TOKEN that allows them to pass proposals in the Agency governance contract.

### Veto
In case of a compromised Special Agent or other security breach, the founders have a special veto mechanism to cancel a prosposal.
