## True Story of Legends

### Art

Encounters is a limited NFT collection of currently 1850 unique creatures from all around the world. 

>Benjamin Silver, a co-founder of the secretive organization, vanished without a trace a decade ago. His legacy, the "Silver Files," meticulously categorizes all creatures into seven Orders, Aspects and Blood Types.

>We have not yet discovered all of them, but thus far, Silver's predictions have proven to be accurate.

### A Decentralized Story

Encounters lie at the heart of every Crypto-Z adventure. Each Agent's initiation into the Agency hinges on experiencing one of these _life-altering_ events, a fundamental tenet of the Crypto-Z protocol.


Each creature, unique and rooted in actual legendary tales, Encounters serves as an accessible canvas for creators and storytellers worldwide.

And each character is an opportunity to discover a new story and learn about a new culture. 

### How many Encounters will be issued?
The realm of legendary creatures and folklore is finite, and our secret database currently houses 1850 of them. 

Each NFT, featuring unique art, metadata, and a captivating story, has been meticulously crafted one by one.
Through our ongoing research, we speculate that there may be an additional 650 creatures deserving of a place in Crypto-Z, ones we haven't yet brought to life.

We also anticipate that our Agents will unveil more of these creatures, and we keep the option open to extend the Encounter Collection to a total of 2500 NFTs.
