### Why is IP-as-Protocol important?

We are building the foundation of composable web3-native IP protocol. Just like **Etherum is the world within which developers and builders can create new applications**, stories and IPs are similarly **the world within which other creators could create new stories**  we want to be the premier protocol to launch them! 

Commencing with Crypto-Z, embrace a new identity as a covert agent within a revolutionary decentralized organization.


### The entertainment industry must change! We know we've been there...
The entertainment industry must undergo a change, and we understand the challenges firsthand!


Stories stand as the sole force uniting creators, fans, and investors. In business, they are recognized as IP – Intellectual Property because stories and characters form the foundational layer for creating defensible value in the entertainment industry.

In the realm of "crypto," we have another term for it — Protocols. Crypto-Z pioneers the concept of IP-as-Protocol, marking a groundbreaking shift in how intellectual property is approached and managed.

### Why are we building?

  <Accordion icon="scale-balanced" title="The Right To Generate Value">
    
IP ownership is often the first sacrifice a creator makes to get their work out in the world. 
   This ownership is theoretically rendered highly modular and fragmentable through a system known as copyrights, encompassing various rights like book publishing, movie, and music rights.

    IP empowers creators to prevent others from extracting value from their stories. 
    <br />It allows creators to generate value by selling those rights.
    <br />It enables buyers to be protected and generate value by building things on top of those IPs.
      
    Originally conceived in the 18th century, this system emerged when technology for property right management didn't exist. This led to the establishment of an entire industry dedicated to overseeing these IP rights.    **And the more complicated managing those rights becomes, the more value is extracted away.** 
    
    However, the more complicated the management of these rights becomes, the more value is extracted away.
    **"Who owns, what, when, and fighting over it" – is a 5.57 billion dollar industry and projected to be 8.66 billion by the end of 2030... according to Google.**
    <br /> It's time for a change in paradigm..


  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="ethereum" title="What Is IP-As-Protocol?">

    IP-as-Protocol can effectively address the question of "Who owns what when?" at all times, eliminating the need for disputes.

    Instead of relinquishing all rights to a few conglomerates and relying on teams of middle management, creators may choose to entrust their rights to a protocol they actively contributed to.   
    
    Why? Because a protocol is ideally trustless, transparent, modular, and can give back value instead of extracting it.

    But that's not even the main benefit...

    **IP-as-Protocols is an entirely new entertainment space where fans, creators, builders and collectors have an aligned incentive to make it successful.**
    **That is why we turned down a Hollywood deal to entrust our IP Crypto-Z to a protocol!** 

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="shield-heart" title="Who Is This For?">
    **Builders, Creators, Collectors and Fans** (in that order) are the 3 key players crucial for the success of Crypto-Z and any other IP-as-protocol.. 
    
    Web3 provides a unique opportunity to align everyone's incentives, creating a flywheel effect that operates like this:    
    
    **"The more stories > the more fans > the more collectors > the more creators > the more stories... and round it goes."**
    
    While all three communities can rally behind the broader mission, they also have dynamics of their own. Crypto-Z is for:
      - **Creators (and builders) who aspire to reach the largest audience possible.** 
      - **Collectors who desire to have a say and witness their collection become increasingly recognized.**
      - **Fans who consistently seek more (great) content.**
      - **Anyone who wishes to be part of the web3 entertainment movement.**

### What we have built so far...

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion icon="fan" title="For Creators">
We are collaborating with Lens Protocol to introduce a groundbreaking publishing and crowdfunding platform, empowering manga and webtoon artists and writers to publish their own Crypto-Z stories.
Creators won't just witness their stories being distributed and collected across the entire Lensverse; they will also have the ability to own and engage with their audience on any other Lens platform.

</Accordion>

<Accordion icon="gem" title="For Collectors">
Encounters are NFTs unlike any other. 
  
**ART & STORYTELLING –** Each Encounters NFT has been created by hand, and is based on real legends from around the world. 
No generative or randomizing software has been used to create Encounters. 
Our NFTs have unique names, identities, and stories to tell (that anyone can discover). Every Encounter minted will be part of the official lore of Crypto-Z, and the center of every story moving forward. Which gets us to the second utility.

**PERMISSIONLESS VOTING RIGHTS –** 100% of the funds are sent to the Agency Treasury which is governed by all NFT holders.

**MISSION-DRIVEN –** We are building defensible IP for web3 entertainment.

</Accordion>

<Accordion icon="heart" title="For Fans">
  
  **Crypto-Z started as a hit podcast (+400k downloads with just 5 episodes) created by Hadrien Royo and NYTimes International Bestselling author Danielle Trussoni**, who wanted to create a mind-blowing sci-fi universe filled with adventures. 
  
  We are launching in Web3 with brand new original content for the podcast and for the platform with our first Creator's cohort.
  Coming soon on www.crypto-z.com
