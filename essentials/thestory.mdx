## Once upon a time...

Crypto-Z started as a hit podcast (+400k downloads with 5 episodes) created by me (Hadrien Royo) and Danielle Trussoni (NYTimes and Internationally Bestselling author) with the intent to sell it as a TV show in Hollywood (fun fact: we had an offer from top-tier studio but turned it down to do this... that was in late 2021).

I joined Seed Club at the same time and started building the protocol. I learned Solidity and have been coding ever since. Recently, we partnered with Lens Protocol to start building the future of publishing.

We started the development of the platform and illustrating the first 1850 characters.

## X-Files meets Jurassic Park

Crypto-Z is a mind-bending "X-Files meets Jurassic Park" universe that explores the gray area between contemporary science and the supernatural. Creatures believed to exist only in legends of folkore are appearing around the world! A secret Agency called Crypto-Z is working to find them before others do.
