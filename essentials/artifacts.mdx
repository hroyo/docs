## Artifact Issuance
Exclusively reserved for Crypto-Z Creators, Artifact is designed to align collectors, creators, and fans. 
At the protocol level can help incentize mints, potentially rewarding collectors with EXP for instance. 
Our hope is to redefine the concept of FanArt, aiding in the discovery of new voices and the widespread dissemination of new Crypto-Z stories.

## The Incentive Stack (aka the Crypto-Z Flywheel).
IP-as-Protocol uniquely enables the creation of an added incentive for all partcipants.
Our vision is to develop tools for our creators and builders, enabling them to layer their personal incentives atop the protocol We believe this a vast area of exploration as it extends potentially to all of Entertainment.

<b/>Whether it is a new Crypto-Z Platform, a roleplaying Game, or an ambitious piece of content the Agency stands ready to support new talent in their endeavors.

## Revenues
Currently Artifact works at a 90% split for the Creator and 10% for the platform which will be reinvested in its own development. 


<Note>The Agency and crypto-z.com have been developed concurrently but independently. The Agency Treasury and the platform are not interconnected.</Note>
